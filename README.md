# VMat-store-virtual-reality-enviroment

Description
This repository presents a project that includes an executable file (.exe) and a dynamic library (.dll) needed to run an application built with Unity 3D. The project is a virtual store that allows users to purchase and download textures for use in software that requires textures to create photorealistic creations.

Operation
The executable (.exe) will start the application built in Unity 3D. Users will be able to explore the virtual store, view previews of available textures and select the ones they wish to purchase. Once the purchase has been made, the program will allow the download of the selected textures, which can then be used in their 3D projects.

Execution
To run the program, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository to your computer.
Navigate to the cloned repository directory and locate the executable (.exe) file.
Run the executable file to launch the virtual texture store Unity 3D application.
Important note
Make sure you respect the licenses and copyrights of the textures offered in the virtual store. You may need to include licensing information or provide credit to texture authors in case they are used in future projects.

Conclusions
This repository offers an example of how to create a 3D application in Unity for a virtual texture store. The project demonstrates how to implement user interaction, asset purchase and download, thus providing a platform for 3D artists and professionals who need textures for their creations. Please adapt the code and instructions to your environment and needs.
